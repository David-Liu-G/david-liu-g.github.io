I bought this smart home device `Click And Grow` on Amazon last sunday to get unlimited basil supply. 

I tried growing basil around summer last year and I failed expectedly. The problem at that time was too little sunlight and too much water. Apparently, if you room is facing north and you place your plant indoor, there won't be enough sunlight for your plant to grow.

I learned my lesson and bought this device. It's a self watering device with LED built in. The LED light is on for 16 hours everyday starting from the moment you plugged it in. The water is inside the box and you are supposed to water it every month. It's been two weeks since I last filled the tank, and there is still plenty of water left inside.

I'm going to take a photo every week and track the progress here. Hopefully, I will get my own basil and tomato this time.
